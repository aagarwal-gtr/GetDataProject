# GetDataProject

## Brief

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Info

Download as ZIP. Unzip folder and set it as the Working Directory in R.
The folder will include the data source with it.
The final output data is saved as tidy_data.txt
All code in run_analysis.R is commented appropriately to explain what it is doing.
